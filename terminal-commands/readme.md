# Terminal Commands - A Cheatsheet to Basics

This cheat sheet is intended to be a quick refresher for the main concepts and commands involved in using a terminal. It is not a comprehensive guide, but should be enough to get the basics covered.

## What is Terminal?

The terminal is a text-based interface for interacting with your computer. It allows you to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible to do using a graphical user interface. The terminal is also known as the _command line_, _shell_, or _console_.

#### Why Use Terminal?

- **Efficiency**: Many tasks can be performed more quickly using a terminal than using a graphical interface.
- **Automation**: You can write scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
- **Flexibility**: A terminal gives you more control over your system than a graphical interface.
- **Remote Access**: You can connect to remote servers using a terminal.
- **Hiring**: Many technical jobs require knowledge of a terminal.
- **Cool Factor**: Using a terminal makes you look like a hacker (even if you're not).

#### Terminal vs Command Line vs Shell

- **Terminal**: The terminal is the program that allows you to interact with a terminal. It provides a text-based interface for running commands.
- **Command Line**: a terminal is the text-based interface itself. It allows you to type commands and receive output.
- **Shell**: The shell is the program that interprets and executes your commands. There are many different shells available, but the most common one is `bash`.
